## Autonomy Roadmap

**Purpose:** Guide Windsurf from a fully supervised environment to gradual, autonomous operation.

### Initial Phase (High Oversight)

- Windsurf proposes code changes.
- Human developers review and approve merges.
- Strictly follow architecture, testing, and environment guidelines.

### Intermediate Phase (Reduced Oversight)

- After consistent success, allow Windsurf to auto-merge trivial or low-risk changes that pass CI/CD checks.
- Human intervention focuses on complex architectural shifts or unusual scenarios.

### Final Phase (Minimal Oversight)

- Once test coverage is high, architecture stable, and CI/CD proven, allow Windsurf to autonomously code, test, and deploy.
- Humans intervene only if critical issues arise or major strategic shifts are needed.
