## Testing and Validation

**Purpose:** 
Outline how to ensure code quality through robust testing, continuous integration, and interactive validation.

### Testing Philosophy

- All code changes require automated tests.
- Aim for high coverage, especially in core logic.
- Integration tests confirm that adapters work correctly with external systems.

### Running Tests

- Command: `docker-compose run --rm app pytest` runs the test suite.
- Use coverage reports (`--cov`) to ensure thorough testing.

### Interactive Validation via IPython

- Before finalizing changes, use IPython to interactively test logic snippets or data transformations.
- If a test fails, correct the code and rerun until it passes.

### Integration with CI/CD

- The CI pipeline will run tests automatically on each proposed change.
- Only changes that pass tests and follow architectural rules will be considered for merging or deployment.
