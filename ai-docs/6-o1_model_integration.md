## Utilizing the OpenAI “o1” Model

**Purpose:** Describe when and how to leverage the o1 model for deep reasoning and architectural improvements.

### When to Use o1

- For complex architectural decisions, large-scale refactoring, or performance optimization.
- For generating high-level improvement plans or security assessments.

### Query Format

- Provide a structured prompt:
  - High-level description of the current architecture, relevant code snippets, or Sourcegraph links.
  - A clear, specific question (e.g., “How can we improve the scalability of the user service?”).

### Incorporating Feedback

- Analyze o1’s recommendations.
- Implement suggested changes step-by-step, ensuring tests pass at each step.
- Re-run CI/CD and re-check architecture adherence after applying o1’s guidance.
