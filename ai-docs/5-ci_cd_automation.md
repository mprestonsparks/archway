## CI/CD and Automation Pipeline

**Purpose:** Explain how to integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate code validation, enable incremental autonomy, and ensure safe deployments.

### CI/CD Overview

- Each commit or pull request triggers:
  - Docker build
  - Unit and integration tests
  - Linting and code quality checks (optional but recommended)

### Automated Policies

- Initially, require human approval to merge changes after CI passes.
- As trust builds, allow the system to auto-merge low-risk changes that pass all tests and checks.

### Integration with Sourcegraph and Local LLM

- CI can query Sourcegraph or the local LLM for code metrics, complexity reports, or summary generation.
- For major refactors, CI scripts can gather context and send it to o1 for review, storing the recommendations.

### Rollbacks and Deployments

- Implement a mechanism to revert to the last known good version if a deployed change fails production tests or health checks.
- Over time, allow automated deployments to staging or production once the system proves stable and reliable.
