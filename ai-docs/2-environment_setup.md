## Environment Setup

**Purpose:** Instructions for Windsurf on setting up and managing the Docker-based environment, integrating Sourcegraph, and configuring both local and cloud LLMs.

### Docker as the Foundation

- Create a `Dockerfile` that installs the project’s runtime, dependencies, and necessary tools (e.g., test frameworks, code formatters).
- Use `docker-compose.yml` to define services:
  - **App container** running the main codebase.
  - **Sourcegraph container** (if running locally) for code indexing.
  - **Local LLM container** providing a simple API to query code suggestions.
  - **Any other necessary services** (databases, caches, etc.).

### Sourcegraph Integration

- Run Sourcegraph as part of your docker-compose setup.
- Ensure it indexes the project’s code after each major update.
- Provide scripts or steps to trigger re-indexing as part of CI/CD if needed.
- Use Sourcegraph’s APIs or UI to retrieve code references, enabling more informed decisions by both local and cloud LLMs.

### Local LLM Setup

- Deploy a local inference server for a code-specialized model (e.g., Code Llama).
- Expose an API endpoint within the Docker network so the main app container can query it for code completions, summaries, or navigation hints.
- Store model weights or access credentials securely, using environment variables as needed.

### OpenAI “o1” Model Integration

- Define a secure communication method (environment variables for API keys) to send summaries and queries to the isolated o1 environment.
- Redact or omit sensitive code segments if required.
- Decide on a standardized prompt format for interacting with o1.

### IPython Integration

- Include IPython in the app container for interactive exploration.
- Command example: `docker-compose run --rm app ipython` to explore code, test logic, or prototype new features quickly.
