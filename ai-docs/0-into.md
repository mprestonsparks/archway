continually indexes the codebase and provides semantic navigation features. Configure Sourcegraph to sync with the local code repository and enable search across branches.

### Local LLM Setup

- Install and configure a lightweight, local LLM (e.g., Code Llama) for rapid, context-aware code suggestions.
- Expose the local LLM as a service via a REST or gRPC API, allowing real-time interactions.

### OpenAI “o1” Model Integration

- Define a secure pipeline for interacting with the o1 model:
  - Summarize large contexts to reduce token usage.
  - Use the o1 model for high-value operations, such as architectural analysis and multi-file refactoring.
  - Store responses locally for reproducibility and further use.

## Document 3: Architecture Guidelines

**Intended Filename:** `ai-docs/architecture_guidelines.md`

**Purpose:** Provide detailed instructions for maintaining a Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters).

### Principles of Hexagonal Architecture

1. **Domain Logic First:**  
   Keep business logic isolated in domain modules. Do not allow direct dependencies on external systems.

2. **Ports and Adapters:**  
   - **Ports:** Define interfaces for external dependencies (e.g., database access, APIs).
   - **Adapters:** Implement these interfaces to integrate with external systems.

3. **Dependency Inversion:**  
   Ensure domain modules depend only on abstractions (ports), not concrete implementations.

4. **Testability:**  
   Design domain logic so that it can be tested independently of external integrations.

5. **Scalability:**  
   Build adapters to support changes in external systems without impacting the domain logic.

## Document 4: Testing and Validation

**Intended Filename:** `ai-docs/testing_and_validation.md`

**Purpose:** Outline robust testing practices to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

### Testing Layers

1. **Unit Tests:**  
   - Cover individual functions and classes.
   - Focus on isolated domain logic.

2. **Integration Tests:**  
   - Test interactions between adapters and ports.
   - Ensure external dependencies are correctly integrated.

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**  
   - Simulate user workflows and validate that the entire system works as expected.

### Test Automation

- Use `pytest` for Python-based tests.
- Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline, requiring all tests to pass before merging code.

### Validation Framework

- Implement pre-commit hooks for static code analysis and formatting.
- Run regression tests on each PR.
- Log test coverage and ensure it remains above a predefined threshold.

## Document 5: CI/CD and Automation Pipeline

**Intended Filename:** `ai-docs/cicd_automation_pipeline.md`

**Purpose:** Explain how to automate code validation and deployment.

### CI/CD Workflow

1. **Code Validation:**
   - Run linters, formatters, and test suites on each pull request.
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate these checks.

2. **Build and Deployment:**
   - Create Docker images for validated code.
   - Deploy to staging environments for manual review.
   - Automate production deployment for minor updates, requiring approval for major changes.

3. **Rollback Mechanism:**
   - Maintain previous versions of Docker images to enable quick rollbacks.

## Document 6: Utilizing the OpenAI “o1” Model

**Intended Filename:** `ai-docs/openai_o1_model.md`

**Purpose:** Describe when and how to use the o1 model for advanced reasoning and tasks.

### Best Use Cases for the o1 Model

1. **Complex Refactoring:**  
   Summarize large or interdependent code sections, solicit refactoring suggestions, and apply updates incrementally.

2. **Architectural Decisions:**  
   Use the o1 model to analyze trade-offs and propose system-level design changes.

3. **Error Diagnosis:**  
   Provide extensive context for difficult bugs, allowing the o1 model to generate hypotheses.

## Document 7: Autonomy Roadmap

**Intended Filename:** `ai-docs/autonomy_roadmap.md`

**Purpose:** Guide Archway’s progression toward full autonomy.

### Phased Approach

1. **Phase 1: Human Oversight**
   - Require manual approval for all changes.
   - Focus on passing test suites and building trust in the system’s capabilities.

2. **Phase 2: Partial Autonomy**
   - Enable automatic merging for non-critical updates (e.g., documentation, formatting).
   - Retain manual reviews for core logic changes.

3. **Phase 3: Full Autonomy**
   - Automate all deployments and updates, with fallback mechanisms for manual intervention if issues arise.
   - Continuously refine self-learning and adaptive processes.
