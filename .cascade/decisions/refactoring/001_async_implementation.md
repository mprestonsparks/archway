# Decision: Async-First Implementation
Date: 2024-12-12
Category: refactoring
Status: accepted

## Context
Need to handle potentially long-running operations and multiple concurrent requests efficiently while maintaining code readability and testability.

## Decision
1. Make all external operations async:
```python
async def analyze_code(self, context: CodeContext) -> AnalysisResult:
    pass

async def suggest_refactoring(self, context: CodeContext) -> RefactoringResult:
    pass
```

2. Use asyncio patterns:
```python
async def execute_with_timeout(self, coro, timeout: float = 30.0):
    try:
        async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):
            return await coro
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        raise TimeoutError(f"Operation timed out after {timeout} seconds")
```

3. Implement proper cleanup:
```python
async def __aenter__(self):
    await self.initialize()
    return self

async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    await self.cleanup()
```

## Consequences
Positive:
- Better resource utilization
- Improved responsiveness
- Clear operation boundaries
- Proper resource cleanup

Negative:
- More complex testing
- Need to handle coroutine lifecycle
- Potential for deadlocks/race conditions

## Implementation
1. Updated BaseProvider interface
2. Modified command execution flow
3. Added async context managers
4. Updated test infrastructure
