# AI Decision Log

This directory maintains a structured log of AI decisions and their rationale. The purpose is to:
1. Maintain consistency across sessions
2. Track architectural decisions
3. Document pattern applications
4. Record dependency choices

## Structure

```
decisions/
├── architectural/     # Major architectural decisions
├── patterns/         # Pattern application decisions
├── dependencies/     # Dependency selection rationale
└── refactoring/      # Code refactoring decisions
```

## Decision Format

Each decision is recorded in a markdown file with the following structure:
```markdown
# Decision: [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Category: [architectural|patterns|dependencies|refactoring]
Status: [proposed|accepted|superseded|deprecated]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]

## Implementation
[How was this decision implemented?]

## References
[Links to related decisions or documentation]
```

## Usage

1. Each significant decision should be documented
2. Use consistent categorization
3. Link related decisions
4. Update status as needed
5. Include implementation details
