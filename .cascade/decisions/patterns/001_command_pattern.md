# Decision: CLI Command Pattern

Category: patterns
Status: accepted

## Context
Need a consistent pattern for implementing CLI commands that supports:
- Configuration management
- Provider integration
- Async operations
- Error handling
- Testing

## Decision
Implement commands using a class-based pattern with:
1. Configuration through dataclasses
2. Lifecycle methods (initialize, execute, cleanup)
3. Provider injection
4. Standardized result type

```python
@dataclass
class CommandConfig:
    name: str
    description: str
    options: List[Option]

class BaseCommand:
    async def initialize(self, provider: BaseProvider) -> None:
        pass
    
    async def execute(self, context: Context) -> Result:
        pass
    
    async def cleanup(self) -> None:
        pass
```

## Consequences
Positive:
- Consistent command structure
- Easy to test
- Clear lifecycle management
- Type-safe configuration

Negative:
- More boilerplate than function-based commands
- Need to manage provider lifecycle
- Potential complexity for simple commands

## Implementation
1. Created BaseCommand class
2. Implemented CommandConfig dataclass
3. Added standard Result type
4. Created command factory
