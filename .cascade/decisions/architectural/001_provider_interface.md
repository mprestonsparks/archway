# Decision: Provider Interface Design

Status: accepted

## Context
Need to design a consistent interface for different AI providers (OpenAI, Local LLM, Sourcegraph) while maintaining extensibility and ease of implementation.

## Decision
Implement an abstract base provider class with:
1. Lifecycle methods (initialize, close)
2. Core analysis methods (analyze_code, suggest_refactoring, explain_architecture)
3. Configuration through dataclasses
4. Async interface for all operations

```python
class BaseProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def close(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def analyze_code(self, context: CodeContext) -> AnalysisResult:
        pass
```

## Consequences
Positive:
- Consistent interface across providers
- Easy to add new providers
- Clear contract for implementation
- Async-first design

Negative:
- All providers must implement all methods
- May need to handle "not implemented" cases
- Potential overhead for simple providers

## Implementation
1. Created BaseProvider abstract class
2. Implemented in O1ModelProvider
3. Added provider factory for instantiation
4. Created provider-specific configurations
